**[SupTube](https://suptube.repl.co) is a new, lightweight Windows client created to enhance the [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com) experience. The app uses the [Tauri](https://tauri.app) framework, which includes a combination of [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) language and [WebView2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2) engine to show YouTube videos. By using the built-in Windows dependencies, the app uses fewer resources, making it an ideal option for those with older or less powerful devices. With a file size of less than 10MB when installed, SupTube is a great choice for those who want a compact, fast-loading app that delivers YouTube video playback without any interruptions.**

## [Releases](https://github.com/sandunwira/SupTube/releases)

## Availability
- [x] Windows
- [ ] Linux
- [ ] MacOS

## Features
- Use less resources.
  - Because of [Tauri](https://tauri.app) (Rust + WebView), users don't need to install anything extra to use this client since WebView is pre-installed with new Windows.
- Pre-installed [AdGuard](https://adguard.app).
  - Client comes with AdGuard pre-installed. So users can watch videos without skipping ads but might not work everytime due to technical difficulties.
- Your privacy matters.
  - You don't need to worry about privacy at all. The app uses official YouTube website to show content so we don't get or store anything related about your personal data.

### Features to be implemented

- [ ] Integrate [SponsorBlock](https://sponsor.ajay.app) with the client.
- [ ] Make Picture-in-Picture (PiP) available
