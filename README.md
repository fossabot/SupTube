### Availability
- :white_check_mark: Windows

- :negative_squared_cross_mark: MacOS

### Features
- Use less resources.
  - Because of [Tauri](https://tauri.app) (Rust + WebView), users don't need to install anything extra to use this client since WebView is pre-installed with new Windows.
- Pre-installed [AdGuard](https://adguard.com).
  - Client comes with AdGuard pre-installed. So users can watch videos without skipping ads.

### Features to be implemented
